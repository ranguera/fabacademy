- mirar video a love letter to plywood
- les lletres davant indiquen el tipus de fusta i la qualitat
- never leave parts of a screw into the sacrificial board
- assegurar-te que fas servir la punta phillips adequada
- clavar recte perpendicular i amb laltra ma apretes des de darrera de la maquina
- first sand pass, use a lower grain number
- in natural wood, primer hem de foradar i despres posar el cargol, o es trencara la fusta
- en plywood podem posar el cargol directament, a noser que posem pel lateral, llavors hem de foradar abans
- 90% of ikea is made of 3axis cnc
- ALWAYS prototype the design in the laser cutter
- you can scale your design proportionally and it should be the same
- sketchair - per dissenyar, simular i wafflejar la cadira
- gear machines are sturdier, belt machines are faster but last less
- 2 types of motors
	- router: cheap, rotate really fast. not much torque
	- spindle: brushless motor, quiteter, more powerful. works on torque.
- collets: clamp your end mill. needs to be clean to wrap properly. make sure you're using the correct size. each collet is designed for a specific measure.
- atc: automatic tool changers. cercle amb tots els mills i la maquina escull el que li duis automaticament.
- always clean the collet and the collet holder.
- when you cut, the chips that fly away are taking heat away from the mill. but depends on the material.
- end mills ARE NOT drill bits.
- types of end mils
	- straight: easy, cheap, dont push up or down.
	- up: most of them: all the motors rotate clockwise, so this cuts takes the material up. Fastest and most standard. Tricky to use: the material can completely lift up or move.
	- down: the opposite. slowest ones. more forgiving when cutting plywood. NEVER make holes, bc the material can't go out.
	- compression: up + down: compresses material to the center. expensive and rare.
- it's always preferred to g odown on the material on a ramp. diagonally
- cut length needs to be bigger than width of material.
- try to choose the shortest possible mill
- if you cut too slow it's not good bc there's not enough material to cool
- too fast it;s getting too full
- the bigger the better - so you speed up the process
-in general, more flutes better and faster cuts. but less forgiving and easier to overheat or break.


4 things to set up for the cutting files:
	- spindle speed: motor you can control by software. between 18k to 24krpm. 
	- feed rate: horizontal speed of cutting
	- step down: Z steps to cut the material. we dont cut the material all at once. we do layers with the z step down. half of the end mill diameter.
	- step over: movement in x/y. also half of diameter.
	
- equation: chip load [0.001 - 0.01] = feed rate / (rpm*num flutes) in inches per minutes.
this equation only works if were using cut depth and step over = diameter/2
google chip load material chart

- formulas are for up cutter. if straight, reduce 10%, down reduce 20%.
- TRUST YOUR EARS. Listen to the noise and make sure its right.
	- too slow: high pitch noise - underfeeding the machine.
	- too fast: overfeeding - mill breaks or low freq noise. like your mouth is full of food.
	- perfect has a constant regular noise.
- if we get noise change on corners, either we reduce rpms and speed.
- climb is the connventional cutting, especially so for woods.
- foam always in conventional, because it's compressible

- cut for 1-2 minutes. stop the machine. touch the end mill - should be warm but not burning. then you have the right params
- tabs: pieces of material that we dont cut to keep the material together, and that are manually cut afterwards.

- safety glasses
- hands on the back. dont touch the material with machine on
- air cut before you cut. see if it goes through any of the screws. If something bad happens usually its within the first 1-3 minutes.
-avoid small parts. they can fly away. or hold them properly.
- pan the cutpaths like the laser cutter. incuts first, etc...
-
- when cuttnig plastics, really fast spindle.
- HDPE: water pipes. cuts really well. 

- when you're cutting wood, you dont want to get dust. you want to get chips. in case of metal, theyre thing and sharp.
- dont touch metal chips with bare hands.
- for instance, carbon fiber dust is too dangerous. you have to cut it inside water.

- be careful with repuprosed material. it sometimes has hidden screws.

- 
- in cut cut inside aligned with line inside.
- outcut- cut aligned with with outer part.
- center cut, centered

- joinery: cut one part to test it before cutting the whole thing, to get the right kerf
- with the CNC, when cutting you're conpressing the aterial, so you do the opposite with the design kerf. you add something. you offset to the offside
- when designing joints, you use t-bones because we cant cut a perfect square. alternative is a dog bone - 2 holes on each side

- always measure the 4 corners of the wood its never the advertised thickness

-
- DESIGN
- draw in millimiters.
- Nest
- multiple sheets in different drawings.
- disable all fils and hatches
- rhinoCAM - import object
- bottom left you can right click and change units.
- draw border cuts, to place screws insides. Different colors for differen styles of cut.
- make sure we have a 3 axis machine selected
- postprocessor - CNC_STEP_BCN
- extension is .nc
- doble click on stock.
- click height and put the material on top. 
- x,y,z = 0. mat dimensions as measured.
- bottom left has options to preview the material and so on.
- See where we wil punt scres and add a point.
- Go to machining operations - 2 axis
- rughing facing - flatenn.
- pocketing remove material
- engraving: on cut, on the line - select the two points that we set for the screws. Engraving is cutting
- tool tab: edit create tool: flat and ball. we choose flat and name it and enter the values.
- feeds and speed on the top right of the creation tool: by default minimum of the motor. we know the cut speed with the chip load equation. The other numbers we set them to 1/2 of it on the top ones, and same speed on the bottom part.
- back to engraving menu: clearance plane: how much we're going up to the next piece. Always put our material height + 20, same for stock.
- Cut parameters: how much we want to cut. we just want to cut a bit so that we know where we're putting the screw. we set it on tota cut depth.
- rough depth cut: make sure it's not above step but max out
- entry/exit: None and none
- sorting: ike vector ordering on aser cuttern. - set to minimum distance sort.
- finally click generate and we'll see the points.
- 
- 
- we do the same with the rest of the shapes. select them and click, engrave. REcHECK SPEEDS.
- cut parameters: OFfset. Ignore cut direction. leave climb for veneer plywood.
- stepover: how much we cut on the side. We always want only to cut a limited % of the diameter - 40
- total cut depth : 10 or whatever
- rough cut remember 3
- generate ans we should see the travel lines.
- 
- cut the outside: profiling not engraving. cut parameters climb.
- total depth: 15.7 to go through all the material. half millimiter more. rough cut remember the closest to 3 or the value that we calculated.
- entry/exit: important when cutting the outside. ALONG PATH. to avoid going through scews. Exit: None
- sorting: minimum distance.
- Number of bridges: always 4 9not sure what tab it ison )
- We can rename the tasks to make it clearer. screws, pocketing, outcut
- We can save one file for each of the tasks, and launch them in order,
- efore that we click simulate and we will see. right click on top of setup.
- save: right cilck and post.
- There are step by step tutorials o the presentation.
