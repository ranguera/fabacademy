COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN

calendari nostre a la web del lab barcelona.
thursday classes on 301

Weekly review
----------------

- Vortex tube: Compressed air in, hot air out on one side, cold air out on the other. Energy inefficient
- 3d scanning sometimes works by projecting lines and analyzing the curvatures.
- For the final project, look at what other groups have done and try to make something not worse than them.

Recitation
--------------

- Assignment: Model something - ideally the final project. Try different softwares. Browse through final projects. Make one of each designs - Use Unity ?
	- Produce audio and video, and embed on the website (the animations and physics)
	- Next week design has to be parametric, so try to do something with it this week.
	- Show that you understood the difference between raster and vector. one design of each
- freecad - constraint solver - keep constraints as you design
- declarative design: you say what you want to do and the tool helps you
- blender: modes - workbenches, like clay sculpt
- solidworks - estefa - constraint solving
- >>> freecad - opensource
	- fillet and chamfer : rounds the edges and facets them
	- cloning important, com prefabs perque es propaguin els canvis
	- treballar amb constraints sempre que sigui possible, per cares que es toquin, distancies etc... aixi les coses s'adapten soles
	- unfolding, create the 2 flat surface out of the 3d object
	- parametric design: pull numbers from a spreadsheet, so that the parameter propagates to the design
	- Turn it into a drawing format for display
	- doesn;t have its own renderer
- >>> Investigar blender constraint solving
- fabconnect solidworks - solidworks talks to the machine building software directly
- "You could do the whole class with Unity"
- Blender physics simulation. Fusion too

- ffmpeg to compress videos
- vokoscreen Ng to capture live windows screen
- no animated gifs unless absolutely necessary - use html5 video
- Trace path, trace bitmap to go from raster to vector
- Image editing: GIMP or Krita
