COMPUTER CONTROLLED CUTTING REVIEW
-------------------------------------

- a good step when cutting different joints is .1mm
- press joints work better with chamfers



ELECTRONICS PRODUCTION
------------------------

- Etching: etch away the copper
- Very polluting
- we'll make the boards by machining - no checmical waste.
-
- do not overtighten the set screw.
- climb vs conventional. TEST
- vinyl cutter: you can cut the circuit and then transfer to the medium. Mirar video a la lesson
- you can also laser cut the board with a fiber laser
- sewing machines using conductive thread
- 
- to create layers, you can add epoxy on top of one and lay out another circuit, connected by vias
- on our boards, we'll dig holes and put rivets
- octopart.com to look for parts
- chip leads dont go under the layer anymore, they spread on top of it
- solders hasve to be shiniy and smooth
- soldador primet i net: posar fil i netejarho amb una esponja
	- posar soldador
	deixarho un rato
	posar material
	deixarho un rato
	treure material
	deixarho un rato
	treure soldador
	
- with flux we can spread the solder over very close pins
- desoldering:
	- braid: posa-lo sobre la soldadura, acostar el soldador, escalfar i hauria de tirar cap amunt del fil.
	- GRAVITY w/ hot air gun
	
- encapsulation: sprays, glues.. make it robust against the environment
- line test pattern on the lesson link. bottom
- look at students examples under isp. if making a usb, use a usb extender to plug it into the pc
- assignment: we can choose isp, updi, or arm parts JTAG ? (Free-DAP))
