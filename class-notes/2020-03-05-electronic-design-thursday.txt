ELECTROINC DESIGN THURSDAY
----------------------------

- resistor calculator on digikey website
- tutoriasl on sparkfun
- if there's no resistance, shortcircuits with infinite current
- dimmming lights have a regulable resistor where you increase or decrease
- a les torres d'ata tensio, hi ha un camp electric al voltant. les vaques quan s'hi acosten tenen una diferencia de potencial entre les potes de davant i les potes de darrera i es fregeixen
- els treballadors fan servir la ma dreta pq si tenen una descarrega passi de ma dreta a peu dret sense passar pel cor

- un condensador, si no te una resistencia entre les potes, es cremara pq descarregara la carrega directa.
- un condensador fitra el soroll de les power supplies pq es va carregant i descarregant. normalment els posem entre els pols de la carrega. p.ex entre usb i el microcontrolador
- els condensadors venen amb limits de voltatge que poden aguantar.

- AC: oscillates between  positive and negative at 50/60hz
- DC: Constant
- AC is better for long distances
- for long distances, theres high voltage and low current to minimize heat dissipations and energy loss

-  Zener diodes are not voltage regulators.
- voltage regulators LDOs are used to regulate for instance usbs 5v to 3.3
- LEDs have a forward resistance but it's really small. thats why we need a resistor between power source and LED
- it doesnt matter if the resistor is before or after the LED
- in the power led resistor circuit, we have 2 voltages, the one that goes to the resistor and the one through the led
- we have to check both voltage and amps on the led datasheet

- the convention is that current goes from + to -

- variable resistances for dimming lights work with an internal disk that regulates the distance electricity has to travel through the high resistance disk.

- Oscillators / resonators - keep the signal sync. microcontrollers have 8 Mhz.
- datasheet tells us how high it can go.
- code needs to ALWAYS tell how fast it is going or there will be a mismatch
with an external one you want to run faster or more accurate.
- speed also depends on the voltage we pass because of intrenal electronics


ASSIGNMENT: 
our switch will need a resistor !


- if we need to move a servo accurately, we will likely need an external resonator to provide more accuracy.


- combinational vs sequential
- combinational circuits dont know their state, just inputs and outputs
- sequential has a state that knows how things are going and we can program it

The Barduino schematic is on gitlab under electronics

once finished the design, generate netlist

then start routing. open routing and load the netlist

next step would be the global design rules, track width and so on

finally start creating routes

if you can't create your board you can add 0 ohm resistors to bridge over

if we need to change a component, we need to regenerate the netlist and so on. on the routing, we can do read current netlist and it will try to save what we had

esp and other chips have a ground in the middle of the chips
when there are antennas, we cant have copper underneath

graphics lines at the end to create the outside of the board. we can do this afterwards, export the svg and editing it

don't trust autoroute

finally export to SVG - select the copper layers, leave everything by default.

Open svg and export each layer with  a different png
Set DPI to 1000
Export only the area of your board.

you can load the svg in mods as well.

you can also export as gerbert and use gerbert to png [ython file on oscars github
