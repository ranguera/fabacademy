ELECTRONIC DESIGN
---------------------


- Each wire on the rainbow wire has it's own resistance etc..
- I = V/R
- Resistors are used to limit current

- C = Q/V

- crystals and resonators: diagram is like a capacitor with a square inside.
- we use them to do accurate timing or faster than the microchips

- Inductor: like a resistance but curly
- V = L di/dt
- used for filtering: prevent high frquency noise from going into the circuit

-diodes: like an arrow, anode to cathode following the arrow
- schottkey diodes can be used in front of a regulator, to prevent current going out
- Zener diode: 
- LED: drawn like a diode with a curly arrow coming out
- 

- regulator: tune down voltage to the desired value
- 


ASSIGNMENT

ATASAM family interacts with usb directly
http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/D11C/hello.D11C.echo.mp4

good one to start
mming/t1614/hello.t1614.echo.png

JUST test it. send a character and get it back

take a free pin, connect a button
take another free pin and connect an led and a resistor 1K ohms. if we dont add the resistor well blow it up

we need to draw the board from scratch

GROUP ASSIGNMENT: use voltmeter, oscilloscope....



- all curents in and  out must add up to 0
power = I^2R = IV
- power equals heat ! you can fry things
- also battery life

conflicts can be avoided with 0ohm resistors

ground core - surround everythinig with extra copper to isolate noise.



building

export to svg
mods - server pcb svg
remember to invert in the 2nd node the colors or we'll mill everything


eagle is integrated into fusion
eagle you can go forward and backwards in the design process:

   hierarchical, parametric drawing
   packages, footprints, libraries
   schematic entry, component placement, (auto)routing, simulation, fabrication
   


gitlab fablab, i pub, electronics, there are libraries we can use.

Digikey has embraced kicad and has libraries for the components
there's one with the most common digikey components


Falstad is a circuit simulator on the browser

pcb.py - python script he wrote to 


asinsmart power supply - you can graduate it. 
oscilloscope analog signals vs time
