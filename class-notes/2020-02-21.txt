- Microcontrollers: 2 main brands: microchip (AVR (ATMega - arduino)/ARM - bigger), espressif
- attiny and atmega: isp
- attiny series 1: ftdi
- ISP will be obsolete
- 
- we program the boards with pyupdi

- 2 steps like arduino: compile and flash
- from the arduino ide you compile for attiny whatever. you can compile but not flash. find the compiled file in the folder on the console. find the hex file.
- python pyupdi.py -h for help
- python pyupdi -d [device] -c [port] -b [bauds] -f [file] -v (verbose)
- if it doesnt work, reduce bauds to 9600
- arduino zero has an arm chip
- arm can be compiled and flashed from the arduino ide. board: generic d11d
- jtag preferred over swd
- Tools: programmer: Jlink over blahblah
