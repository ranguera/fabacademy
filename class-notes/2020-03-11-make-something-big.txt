- polycarbonate - reallky tough . hard to laser, easy to machine
- garolite machines easilym great structura properties
- drilling vs milling: milling cuts on bottom and sides.
	- fewer flutes to rough out material, more to fine tune
- uncoated mills not recommended
- when flutes meet in the middle you can go down to center cuts
- flute orientation: when milling we want to push chips out but doing so we create breaks on the surface
q- trick: shallow down cut and then up cut
- flat end mills can do smooth surfaees if w can move it slowly. ball end mills its easier
- but ball end mills will create uneven floors at some points
- chip load: how much each too bites in. respect the values

- fixing material: drill control holes and put screws in that tie to the bottom layers. better than c clamps

- runout: mes enlla del kerf pq l'eina es mou una mica
- climb gives the best finish. used for finishing
- conventional: less force on the machine. used for roughing
- trochoidal: moves the mill forward in circles
- press fits wont work bc nils are round. we need to do t- boning ? create spheres on the edges
- recomended: run your job in the air to make sure.
- make a little prototype: laser cut or print.
- shopbot VcarvePRO
- Fusion: has nice cam capabilities - design + simulate
- slicer: take 3d parts and turn it into 2d cuttable shapes
- mods has programs for different files. Can also do finish cuts very smooth
- we can produce the gcode directly as well]
- always turn out the power before touching the machine'
- 
- group assignment: make a cube, make sure its straight
come out with a table of speeds and feeds for out material.
