INPUT DEVICES
---------------

- A switch is a sensor in a sense.
- motion, pyroelectric or doppler radar, measure changes on IR energy produced by movements. Not proximity
- Radar sends microwave and if you';re moving with the reflection you can measure movement.
- for proximity sensors, if the object is tilted, the reflection goes away and doesn't work
- LIDAR: rotating laser and measure distance / change the modulation and measures modulation changes... different modfes

- Magnetic fields: can sense the earth's field.
- joysticks use an internal system of magnets. hall effects.

- temperature: measured with thermal resistors - thermistors
- processors have an internal temperature sensor that you can read

leds can be used as low accuracy light sensors.
you can measure the light that bounces off a surface as well

- microfon. idea: guitarra i visualitzacio unity
- mems microfon is good as the cellphone

step response - can be many sensors.

gps for ~$10

pulse rate + blood oxygen

asignment: dissenyar una board ! - step response es lo mes facil ?
learn about adc, comparators...
