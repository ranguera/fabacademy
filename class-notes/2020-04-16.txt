CLASS AFTER OUTPUT DEVICES
--------------------------------

Motors: Voltage is related to speed, current is related to torque
mosfets are like relays but easier to use, take less space. but can handle less current.
Common to use mosfets with heatsinks bc they heat up with continuous usage

pololu drives: used to drive stepper motors.
