Computer controlled cutting
-----------------------------

Additive - 3d printing. layer by layer - usually not as strong os substractive
substractive - cutting

- usually 0.2mm beam at the surface after concetration by the lens. from the focus point on, the laser diverges
- with thin materials, like 1mm, you focus on the surface
- with more concave lenses, you need more spce for the focus point, but you also have less divergence after it.
- lenses are about 500euros
- for paper folding, instead of designing a dash line, you create a full line and set it to a slow freq so it just creates dots
- air prevents smoke to come up, bc the laser doesnt push anything out, its just air
- fiber laser cutters: with fiber optics

- unfolding 3d: for instance with grasshopper

- nesting: put everything together to reduce waste
	IMPORTANT:  order the vectors by proximity of start and end points
	sw usually has an ordering of the layers: deepnest, svgnest, opennest
	for cardboard: distance between lines 3 to 5
	
size of the beam usually .15. size of the cut usualy .25. if you cut a 100mm square, the piece will be 99.5mm
- materials have different compressibility, so press fits are more or less tolerable. cardboard will bend, metal wont
- kerfing: using single lines to carve a line to make bending surfaces, as opposed to drawing both ends of the cut
- waffle: sturdy pieces, furniture
- tessellating. cutting planar while preditcing how it will bend and bending

-vector or raster
1-1 scale in mm

1) draw cutting area
2) draw material size
3) design inside

- use basic rgb colors rgb ymck

make sure your design is flat from the top
if there are two lines on top of each other therell be two passes, making the cut wider.
- rhinocam has the command seldup to pick the duplicate lines

the order of the layers of cutting on the interface (colors)also matters. cutting inner parts first is recommended, if you cut outer ones, the inner part might move
if plastics have chlorine, dont cut

make sure smoke extraction and air compressor are on
you can cut pasta

flatfab - structural testing to know where things will break
- makercase: will build the press fit joints
laser origami videos: uses defocusing to bend plastic via gravity

pepakura: unfolding for a lot of things

how to laser cut like a boss: snaps, kerfing, joints, living hinges... lasercutlikeaboss.weebly
when there are points with lots of stress, adding up a curve relieves tension. so instead of 90deg, you have  curvature
